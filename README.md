# StegaMed

### **A Python-based Steganography Tool for Securing Medical Information**

StegaMed is a project that implements steganography to securely embed medical reports into images. This ensures that sensitive medical information remains hidden yet accessible when needed.

---

## Features

- üîí **Secure Medical Data Embedding**: Uses the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique to hide medical information in images.
- üñºÔ∏è **Supports PNG Images**: Works with lossless `.png` image format for data integrity.
- üìú **Medical Report Handling**: Embeds structured medical reports in JSON format.
- üîç **Data Extraction**: Retrieves hidden information seamlessly without altering the original data.

---

## Use Cases

- **Healthcare**: Securely share patient records with embedded medical data in diagnostic images.
- **Data Security**: Protect sensitive information in plain sight.

---

## How It Works

1. **Prepare Input Image**:
   - Upload a `.png` file as the cover image for embedding data.
2. **Medical Report**:
   - The tool encodes a medical report (in JSON format) into the image's pixel values.
3. **Embedding**:
   - Encodes data into the least significant bits (LSBs) of pixel values.
4. **Extraction**:
   - Retrieves the embedded medical information without visual degradation.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**
- Libraries:
  - `Pillow`: For image processing.
  - `matplotlib`: For image visualization (optional in Colab).

Install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install pillow matplotlib
